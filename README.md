# surfs_up
## Overview
In this project, we are asked to gather to temperature statistics of the months June and December and determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. 

## Analysis
To do this analysis, we need to run two separate queries. One for the month of June and one for December. Afterwards, we store the temperatures into a list, then convert the list into a dataframe. Finally, we can use the decribe() method to obtain our statistics.

The image below shows the temperature statistics for June.

## Results
For June, we can see that there was a total count of 1700.0, a mean of 74.9, a min of 64.0, and a max of 85.0.
For December, we can that there was a total count of 1517.0 a mean of 71.0, a min of 56.0 and a max of 83.0.
The standard deviation for June is 3.25 whereas Decembers is 3.75, which is a 0.5 percent difference between the two seasons.

### Summary
The overall temperatures for June and December in 2017 are very close. One noticable difference was that Junes min was 64.0 and Decembers was 56.0 

We can see what the temperatures are with out data, but we can run additional queries. For example, one quarry we can run is percipiation differneces in June and December and see which month has more rainfall. Or, we could run an additional quarry on the stations to see only stations that are near the new shop location. Doing so would show more accurate weather results.
