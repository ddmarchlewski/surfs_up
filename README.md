# surfs_up
## Overview
In this project, we are asked to gather to temperature statistics of the months June and December and determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. 

## Analysis
To do this analysis, we need to run two separate queries. One for the month of June and one for December. Afterwards, we store the temperatures into a list, then convert the list into a dataframe. Finally, we can use the decribe() method to obtain our statistics.

The image below shows the temperature statistics for June.
